## Refactoring  Parking-Lot Application

1. Primitive Obsession
    - Created a constant for all String values used
    
2. Dead Code
    - Current checking for emptyList is no longer needed because it was handled in the other methods
    
3. Switch Statements 
    - Multiple if statements can be coupled together

4. Long Method 
    - Many executable codes in the ParkingBoy methods
    
5. Speculative Generality
    - if statement is not needed anymore
    
6. Extracted to method
    - Not exactly code smell, but refactored to extract in separate method 
    and made descriptive method name to increase readability as part of clean code practice
