## Refactoring  Parking-Lot Application

1. Primitive Obsession
    - Created a constant for all String values used
    
2. Dead Code
    - Current checking for emptyList is no longer needed because it was handled in the other methods
    
3. Switch Statements
    - Multiple if statements can be coupled together
    
4. Speculative Generality
    - if statement is not needed anymore
